# Pointless

### A scripting language for learning and fun

I've made this site to share a project I've been working on intermittently for the last couple of years - a programming language called Pointless. The language is a distillation of some of the concepts from functional programming that I find interesting, with a design goal that can be roughly summarized as "creating the programming language that I'd like to have learned as a beginner programmer". This language is still very much in-the-works, but I'm excited to share the progress that I've made so far. More information can be found in the examples and documentation sections.
